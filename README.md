## 📌 Project Overview  

This repository contains my solutions for **Homework 1** in Natural Language Processing, including:  

- **Q2 — Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**  
  - Manual BPE analysis on a toy corpus  
  - Implementation of a mini BPE learner in Python  
  - Segmentation of words such as: `new`, `newer`, `lowest`, `widest`, `newestest`  

- **Q5 — Tokenization in Telugu**  
  - Naïve space-based tokenization  
  - Manual tokenization with suffix handling (`లో, కు, తో, పై`)  
  - Tokenization using **Indic NLP Library**  
  - Comparison of the three approaches  
  - Identification of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in Telugu  

The goal of this assignment is to understand how tokenization works across languages and how subword models like BPE help reduce the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem.
